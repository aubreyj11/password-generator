## Description
The purpose of this site is to generate random passwords based on a list of criteria provided by the user. I learned through making this project how important loops are and even learned a new element called a "do loop". This website will be useful for users who are in need of a random password and want to have one generated for them based on their requirements.

## Usage
Click the "Generate" button for prompts to appear. Once prompts appear, please select which criteria you would like to be included in your password, being careful to stay within the range of requirements. Each password must be between 8 and 128 characters and include at least one type of character (lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters) to be generated.
